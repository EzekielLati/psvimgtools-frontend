LOADING ROM FILES (.A26 or .BIN)
------------

If you want to load rom images in the virtual drive
of your emulator, you have to put your rom file (with
.zip, .bin or .a26 file extension) on your PSP memory
stick in the 'roms' directory. 

Then, while inside Atari 2600 emulator, just press
SELECT to enter in the emulator main menu, choose
"Load ROM" and then using the file selector choose one
game file to load in your emulator. Back to the
emulator window, your game should run automatically.

FLICKERING 
------------

On several games such as Asteroids or Missile
Command, the screen flicks, or the color are dark.
You can then change the Flicker mode parameters in
the Settings menu. For example, Asteroids is very
nice using the "Simple" anti-flicker mode.

AUTO-FIRE
------------

It may happens that autofire can not be stopped. 
You have then to go to the settings menu and 
set auto fire option to off ...
